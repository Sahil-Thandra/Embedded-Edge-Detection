# Image-Egde-Detection-Using-Embedded-Processor
The aim of this project is to detect edges in a given image using special DSP based Embedded Hardware Processor FRDM-KL25Z MCU.

## Description
In this project, two edge detection algorithms, Sobel Edge Detection & Canny Edge Detection, have been implemented in C and each algorithm is tested by flashing each of them into the FRDM-KL25Z board.The image data is being serially sent to the board where the data is being processed by the FRDM processor and the resultant image data is sent to PC from the board.
